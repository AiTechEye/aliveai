The "AI Book"  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AiTechEye/aliveai/master/aliveai/textures/aliveai_book.png"> is just added, use it on or near AI/bots/blocks to add them (add a page about them) to the book.
But to fill the book you have to travel around in the world to find them, but what happens when you collected all?
